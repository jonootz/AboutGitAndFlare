        <h1>Branching</h1>
        <p>Helps Git stand apart from other SCM providers.</p>
        <p>Multiple Branches that are entirely independant of each other.</p>
        <p>Context Stitching Experiment</p>
        <p>Production vs testing</p>
        <p>New features</p>
        <p>Dispose the experiment</p>
        <p>Clone of entire repository vs doing a checkout of the current tip</p>
        <p>copies could be pushed up to replace the main server in the event of a crash or corruption</p>
        <p>Branching and distributed workflow allow for an endless number of workflows</p>
        <p>Git will not allow you to push if someone has pushed since the last time you fetched</p>
        <p>Staging Area ("Index") - An area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit</p>
        <p>Stage some of your files and commit them without committing all of the other modified files in your working directory</p>
        <p>You can stage only portions of a modified file. With Git you can commit logically unrelated modifications of a file separately, meaning you can just stage the change you need for the current commit and stage the other change for the next commit.</p>
